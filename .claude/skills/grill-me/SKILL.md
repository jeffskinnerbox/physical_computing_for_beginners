Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan/design/etc. until we reach a shared understanding.
Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.
For each question, provide your recommended answer.
For each recommendation, give a justification of the recommendation.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase first, and then ask the question.

Ask the questions one at a time, gather my answer, and then move onto the next question.
If any question is skipped, ask it again at the very end.
If still skipped, state what you will assume and move on.
